       <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">
Bright orange birds chirp at each other as part of their morning routine while Germán Méndez
fries a couple of fresh eggs in his kitchen, styled with large Mexican tiles. He lives isolated in
the jungle of Cozumel, Yucatán—the only island in Mexico with a jungle. Not a single sound of
civilization, and Germán couldn’t be happier. </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">

His grueling work consists of endless efforts to revive the long-forgotten reefs. His face is
marked with deep grief—he’s seen firsthand the demise of the corals over the last 30 years.
We follow him through his restoration site as the tragic story of Cozumel’s ecological disaster
unfolds. </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">

Across the Gulf of Mexico, a family with two children slam their doors and trip over oversized
suitcases as they rush to a taxi waiting by the curb. A long-awaited holiday for the parents
and an ecstatic adventure for the children. Soon, they’ll board a cruise ship—larger than the
buildings lining the Miami skyline.        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Act II</h3>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">
In a bitter twist, Germán’s work is partly funded by the very industry he resents. As part of his job, he
leads diving tours for tourists—often arriving by cruise ships—who unknowingly contribute to the
reefs’ destruction. He shows them the damage firsthand, sometimes blaming them outright, unable to
contain his frustration. </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">

But it becomes clear Germán has a purpose behind his actions. He wants to leave a mark on this earth
before he perishes. </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">

Soon, the family’s ship docks at one of many piers on Cozumel. They step onto the island, so foreign to
them. Meanwhile, Germán gears up to lead another tour. In a short time, the family and Germán will
meet—to face the uncomfortable reality of their vacation. </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">

Germán takes them on a tour of the island. With a mixture of fury and almost pleasure, he shows
them the destruction brought by tourism. The family watches—stunned—as their fantasy melts into
the barren ashes of the trees below them.        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Act III</h3>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">
The family, there to enjoy an escape on a tropical island, watches in dismay as they realize they’ve stepped
into a wildlife cemetery. The question stands: with such limited options, are they really the problem? Their
ignorance, their plea for a simple vacation, their fantasy of a foreign land.</p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">

Yet in weary steps, Germán’s attitude begins to shift. Beneath his critical remarks about the tourists, we
glimpse a kind soul. Ultimately, it’s clear he wishes for the health of the land for all of us—it’s one man’s battle
against a system so large, perhaps no single individual can stop it anymore. </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">

The family and Germán share still moments. They laugh and reflect. Soon, the family departs. The return trip
on the cruise feels familiar, but now through a different lens. They step back onto the soil of home, preparing
for another day of work—their escape now over. </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">

Germán wakes up to another day in the jungle. The birds chirp at the sight of their neighbor. The dogs chase
chickens through the yard. He puts on his helmet, and we follow hitm along his daily route on his scooter. He
nods at fellow islanders working food stalls, serving tourists. </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-2">

Though he knows there is no easy escape from a system locked into society, he perseveres. For he does not
aim to stop—until he sees his own children beneath the water saved.        </p>
