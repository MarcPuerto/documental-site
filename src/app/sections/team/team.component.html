          Kaito Sashihara Martínez is a
half Japanese half Spanish director
and cinematographer focused on
multicultural productions. He
previously worked on productions
across Spain, Germany, Mexico,
Portugal, Sweden, and Japan. His skill
set in niche guerrilla style productions
paired with his underwater
cinematography has set him on a path
to a free-flowing journalistic working
style.
Currently based in Berlin—where he earned his BA in Film Production
from Catalyst Institute for Creative Arts—his debut short film “Pelargonía”
led him to participate in the 78th Cannes Film Festival in the Short Film
Corner. He is currently working on his first documentary feature as well as
in pre-production for a fiction feature and an animated short film.
